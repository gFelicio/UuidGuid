# UuidGuid

Functions written in PHP that generates UUIDS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first function, which was created by Andrew Moore in http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.uniqid.php#94959 , is in compliance with RFC 4122.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONSIDERATIONS

The function was developed to work in plain PHP projects, but might work with PHP Frameworks, like Laravel.

Since the function uses rand(), mt_rand() or similar functions to generate the UUIDs, the randomness of the generated UUIDs are NOT GUARANTEED TO BE UNIQUE.

If your project just demands a random generated number to fill an UUID number, but you don't need it to be an unique key number, feel free to use this function.

If your projects demand uniqueness and "cryptographical" key fields, there is no guarantee that these functions will generate safe UUIDs.
